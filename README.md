## Overview
**FamilyProgressWeb** is a static HTML page that visually tracks the progress of family members, displaying their birthdays and pregnancy progress bars. The website is dynamically generated from a JSON file containing birth dates and pregnancy statuses.

🔗 **Live Website:** [FamilyProgressWeb](https://family-expansion.web.app/)

## Features
- Displays family members' names, birthdays, and a progress bar showing time until the next birthday.
- Supports pregnancy tracking by showing expected birth dates.
- Automatically updates when new data is added.
- Deploys automatically to Firebase Hosting.
- Allows users to upload new photos by creating a GitHub issue.
- Scheduled daily deployment to keep data updated.

```

## Data Format
The `data.json` file should contain entries in the following format:
```json
[
    {
        "nombre": "John Doe",
        "fecha": "25/09/2017"
    },
    {
        "nombre": "Jane Smith",
        "fecha": "28/08/2018"
    },
    {
        "nombre": "Baby Doe",
        "fecha": "04/07/2025",
        "embarazo": true
    }
]
```

## Setup & Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3 installed
- Firebase CLI installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- A Firebase account and a configured project
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FamilyProgressWeb.git
   cd FamilyProgressWeb
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If required
   ```
3. Authenticate Firebase:
   ```sh
   firebase login
   firebase init hosting
   ```
4. Configure Firebase settings (`firebase.json` and `.firebaserc` files as needed).

## GitHub Actions Workflow
### Rendering & Deployment
- A GitHub Action (`deploy.yml`) runs `render.py` to update `index.html` whenever changes are made to `data.json`.
- The updated site is deployed to Firebase.
- A scheduled daily action at **12:00 UTC** updates the page to reflect any changes.

### Uploading Photos
- Creating an **issue** with the child's name as the title and attaching an image triggers the `upload_image.yml` action.
- The image is added to the repository, committed, and a new deployment is triggered.

## Deployment
After making changes, you can manually deploy the site with:
```sh
firebase deploy
```

Alternatively, push changes to GitHub, and the workflow will handle the deployment automatically.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`feature-branch`).
3. Commit changes and push.
4. Open a Pull Request for review.
